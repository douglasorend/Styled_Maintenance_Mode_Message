[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
When any Simple Machines forum is in maintenance mode (where [i]$maintenance[/i] in [b]Settings.php[/b] is set to 2), there is absolutely no CSS style to make the maintenance message look consistent with the rest of the site.  This mod resolves this issue, using the default theme CSS, to style the maintenance mode message shown to the user.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Restrictions[/u][/size][/b][/color]
Since theme support has not been loaded as of this point, other themes cannot be selected within the UI at this point.  This may change in future versions.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Admin Settings[/u][/size][/b][/color]
There are none.  You must uninstall this mod to remove it.

[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Compatibility Notes[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.9, but should work on SMF 2.1 Beta 1, as well as SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
